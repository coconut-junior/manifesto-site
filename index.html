		Take a look at some of the most talented and well-regarded designers. Now look at some of your own work. Maybe you can’t help but feel that those individuals were gifted with a special talent, or maybe they got lucky and you’d never stand a chance at becoming that skilled. Think again. All those people have one thing in common, and that’s discipline. I strongly believe that before you can focus on your design work, you need to focus on yourself. Can you get up every morning when your alarm clock goes off? Can you get yourself to practice consistently even when nobody’s telling you to? If you can’t do any of those things, then you never truly will know how good you can become. Every person has potential to become the next big designer. The first step to getting there is learning how to work like one.
